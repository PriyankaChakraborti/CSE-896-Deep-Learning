    "#### TF Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is a Python library for setting up computation graphs and running them. Computation graphs live in their own context, outside of the normal Python context. Thus, members of the graph can't be interacted with directly, but only through certain calls of the TensorFlow library. Today, we'll introduce the most basic tools you'll be using this semester to build and run highly-optimized computation graphs which run on both CPU and GPU.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://imgur.com/8naUUs4.png\" alt=\"TF Graph concept\" width=400/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A computational graph is a series of TensorFlow operations arranged into a graph. Each graph node corresponds to an operation that takes zero or more tensors as inputs and produces tensors as output. This is called the tensor-in tensor-out (TITO) model, and we think of tensors as the edges between node operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://imgur.com/Sw1JNnC.png\" alt=\"Example computation graph\" width=\"250\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow programs typically consist of two sections:\n",
    "1. Building the computation graph\n",
    "2. Running the computation graph\n",
    "\n",
    "These must both be accomplished with TensorFlow code written in Python, but this setup allows the computation to be highly optimized to be able to run contemorary deep learning algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic unit of data in TensorFlow is the [Tensor](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Tensor). A tensor consists of a set of primitive values (think `float` or `int`) shaped into an n-dimensional array. It represents an edge in the TensorFlow graph. We say that a tensor's _rank_ is its number of dimensions. Here are some examples of tensors:\n",
    "```\n",
    "its_complicated = tf.Variable(12.3 - 4.85j, tf.complex64)   # a rank 0 tensor; a scalar with shape []\n",
    "first_primes = tf.Variable([2, 3, 5, 7, 11], tf.int32)      # a rank 1 tensor; a vector with shape [5]\n",
    "myxor = tf.Variable([[False, True],[True, False]], tf.bool) # a rank 2 tensor; a matrix with shape [2, 2]\n",
    "my_image = tf.zeros([10, 299, 299, 3])                      # a rank 4 tensor with shape [10, 299, 299, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "There are two ways of accessing the shape of a `tf.Tensor`. The first is used during graph construction by reading the `shape` property of a tensor (e.g., `node1.shape`), which returns a [TensorShape](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/TensorShape) object. The second, at runtime, can be done by running the [tf.shape](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/shape) operation. Tensors can be reshaped with [tf.reshape](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/reshape).\n",
